# Dynamic Reentrant Library

The Dynamic Reentrant library facilitates communication between 
[Rxn Rover](https://rxnrover.github.io/RxnRover) and its 
[plugins](https://rxnrover.github.io/PluginCatalog), and helps manage dynamic 
reentrant VIs. This library will likely be used by Rxn Rover and all of its 
plugins (at least first-party).

## Installation

Download the library by clicking the "Code" button and selecting "Download 
ZIP". Extract the ZIP file into your `<labview>/user.lib/` directory, where 
`<labview>` is the location of your LabVIEW installation. `user.lib` is where 
user-created, common libraries used across multiple projects are located.
